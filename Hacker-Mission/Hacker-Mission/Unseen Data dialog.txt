Are you Specter?

Specter — 21:14
Depends. Who’s asking?

Buyer47 — 21:15
Someone who was told you have “the package.”
I have the access code. Sending now.

Buyer47 sent a file: access.key

Specter — 21:16
Received.
Alright. What exactly do you think I have?

Buyer47 — 21:16
You said millions of records.
Is it real or just talk?

Specter — 21:17
It’s real.
Structured database system.
Indexed collections.
Metadata fully normalized.
Logs included.
Everything engineered cleanly.

Buyer47 — 21:17
Why are you selling it?

Specter — 21:18
Because the company I built it for doesn’t pay what it’s worth.
I created the architecture.
I cleaned every corrupted entry.
Now they want to pretend it was “a team effort.”
So I’m selling the framework, not their data.

Buyer47 — 21:18
So nothing illegal?

Specter — 21:18
Nothing personal, nothing sensitive, nothing stolen.
Just the system, the structure, the engine.
You want a sample?

Buyer47 — 21:19
Yes. Show me.

Specter — 21:19
Uploading preview…

Specter sent a file: preview.json

Specter — 21:19
All anonymized.
Logs cleaned.
Schema included.
Dashboards ready to deploy.

Buyer47 — 21:20
…Okay.
The tables look good.
The log handler too.
Is that real-time indexing?

Specter — 21:20
Of course.
I don’t sell garbage.
This can power anything you want to build.

Buyer47 — 21:21
Price still the same?

Specter — 21:21
Not negotiable.

Buyer47 — 21:21
Fine. Sending the transfer now.

Buyer47 sent: payment.confirmation

Specter — 21:22
Confirmed.
Sending the full package.
